## Volkswagen CI

[volkswagen](https://github.com/auchenberg/volkswagen) - "Volkswagen detects when your tests are being run in a CI server, and makes them pass."

Remember the Volkswagen emissions scandal back in 2015? You know, the one where Volkswagen had software in their diesel engines that could detect when they were being tested and change the performance accordingly to improve results. Yeah, cheating for having great results...a very inspiring story that led to the development of amazing open source projects like the [volkswagen](https://github.com/auchenberg/volkswagen) project.

As you know, CI is the practice (and also tooling) of testing and integrating your code often. If you submitted a bad code, the CI will not merge it. That's a real bummer for people who write bad code. But fear no more, installing the volkswagen project on the CI server will make the CI always pass, just like the software Volkswagen installed.

Funny thing is, if you go the project page, you can actually see it's used by some other projects :)

## Bash Insulter

[bash-instuler](https://github.com/hkbakke/bash-insulter) - "Insults the user when typing wrong command"

If you ever used the command line you know that doing mistakes is inevitable. At some point, you'll make mistakes like spelling, missing characters, etc. But that's fine, right? well not according to the bash-insulter project.

This project insults the user whenever he/she types a wrong command. Some of the insults are:

* "What if... you type an actual command the next time!"
* "This is why nobody likes you"
* "This is not a search engine."

The full list of insults that contributed by multiple contributors can be found [here](https://github.com/hkbakke/bash-insulter/blob/master/src/bash.command-not-found#L6). It's always heartwarming to see how the community works together to make the world a better place.

## Thanos JS

[thanos-js](https://github.com/anandundavia/thanos-js)

Whether you are Marvel fans or not, you probably have watched the Avengers movies or at least heard about them. In the last two Avengers movies, the main villain is a purple alien called Thanos. And Thanos is a true believer of balance. He believes that overpopulation can and should be fixed by wiping out half of the galaxy population. Whether he manages to do that or not is something I will not reveal here because I hate spoilers (although it's a Marvel Disney movie, how do you think it ended?!)

Anyway, Thanos was a true hero for many people and a great inspiration. This inspiration led to great (useless) projects like [thanos-js](https://github.com/anandundavia/thanos-js)

thanos-js will remove exactly half of the files on your computer. Each file is given a chance to be part of 50% files that removed or the 50% lucky files which will stay untouched. Eventually, you'll have a perfectly balanced system, like all systems should be. Assuming it will still run...

## Bullshit.js

[bullshit.js](https://github.com/mourner/bullshit.js)

Don't let the name of the project to fool you. This project is no bullshit. It has a mission-critical purpose of translating marketing speak into human-readable text. In this case, a demo worth thousands of words: https://mourner.github.io/bullshit.js

## Pizza-Dough

[pizza-dough](https://github.com/hendricius/pizza-dough) - "This recipe is dedicated to helping you make the best possible pizza dough for Neapolitan pizza"

The pizza-dough is actually a very serious project. I mean just show me a more scientific, serious and accurate source for making pizza dough. And that's also exactly why it's funny. Open Source recipes are the next thing, remember where you first read it...
It's also good GitHub preserves open source code in an Arctic vault. Humanity will need this Pizza dough recipe in the post-apocalyptic era.

## More funny open source projects

That's it. I hope you enjoyed this post. Very different from what I'm usually writing about, but for me, it was fun :)
If you know about other funny open source projects, let us know in the comments.
