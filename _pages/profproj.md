*A 3rd year group project to create a sequel to a client's game.*

Due to the nature of the brief, I am unable to show much here, but am able to provide a gameplay video upon request.

During the project, I was the lead programmer as well as contributing to most of the design, other than the core concept which was provided by the client. The experience was useful for me to lead a small programming team and take charge of most of the presenting and creating of builds as it gave me a better understanding of how a small games team operates. For more information on this project, please contact me.
