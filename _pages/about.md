Hello, My name is Arie Bregman and I'm a DevOps enthusiastic. When I started to learn about DevOps, I found it quite challenging to find good materials. There are many good resources out there but it's not always easy to find them.

For this reason, I have created DevOpsBit. The goal of DevOpsBit is to share knowledge on DevOps and DevOps related topics. You'll find different types of resources here - blog posts, checklists, roadmaps and references to other great resources. All the resources in this site are completely FREE.

Enjoy Learning :)
