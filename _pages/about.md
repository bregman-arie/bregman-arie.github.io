My name is Arie Bregman. I've created this site for anyone interested in DevOps.

All the resources in this site are completely free and will remain so in the future. The goal of DevOpsBit is to share knowledge on DevOps and DevOps related topics. You'll fine different types of resources here - blog posts, checklists, roadmaps and references to other great resources.

I hope you'll enjoy learning using this site :)
Feel free to send me any feedback, positive or negative, so we can keep improving DevOpsBit together.
