Hello, My name is Arie Bregman and I'm a DevOps enthusiastic. When I started to learn about DevOps, I found it quite challenging to find good materials. There are many good resources out there but it's not always easy to find them.

For this reason, I have created DevOpsBit. The goal of DevOpsBit is to share knowledge on DevOps and DevOps related topics. You'll fine different types of resources here - blog posts, checklists, roadmaps and references to other great resources. All the resources in this site are completely FREE.

Feel free to send me any feedback, positive or negative, you have on DevOpsBit.
I hope DevOpsBit will serve you well in your journey of learning :)

P.S.

If you are wondering "why this site looks so strange?" I'll just say that I'm not a designer...and apparently never will be :'(
