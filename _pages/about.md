I am a 4th year at Abertay University, studying 'Computer Games Technology'.

After high-school, I moved from Edinburgh to Dundee to begin my studies at Abertay university, where I have now become efficient in C++ and C# coding. Due to my love for video games, I have been developing games both as part of university coursework and outside, in my spare time either within a group or just as smaller solo projects. Most of my talent is within programming, specifically with coding game mechanics and I am particularly interested in creating gameplay or physics simulations but I have found great value working as part of a team and always contribute to design processes.
