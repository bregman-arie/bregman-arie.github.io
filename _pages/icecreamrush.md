*Ice Cream Rush was a game created for the PSVita as part of a game architectures module during my 2nd year at university.*

Using Box2D and a basic PSVita framework, I created this fast serving ice-cream game with C++, to make use of both the Vita's joysticks and touch screen controls.

The game has multiple features such as different game states, difficulty toggle, random generated orders, score and time tracking as well as music/sound effects integrated.

2.5D assets and game play involving object-orientated programming to manipulate multiple items in the scene and make full use of the physics that can be created using Box2D.
