*This project was created as part of a networking module during my 2nd year at university.*

[Example Scripts]({{"https://github.com/LeSmurk/ExampleCode/tree/master/Networking"}}){: .btn .btn--primary .btn--large}

Using SFML, I created this application to test the differences between TCP and UDP networking, both in their performance as well as how the two are programmed.The game consists of tow players, both constrained to one side of the screen (top or bottom) and their goal is to throw a hook out to catch the other player and drag them into the centre of the screen, into a pit.

The coursework brief was to simply make a fully networked game, however, I wanted to test the differences between the two networking protocols and how they two compare, particularly how the choice of the different protocols changes the way that the communications between the two clients/server is programmed.
