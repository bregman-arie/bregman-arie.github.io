"Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly-scalable object storage. Unity developers can take advantage of S3 to dynamically load assets used by their games. This can make games initially download quicker from app stores."

S3 features:

    * Tiered Storage Available
    * Lifecycle Management - manage which storage tier<br>
      the file you uploaded goes to
    * Versioning - managing different versions of your file
      and restore previous versions
    * Encryption
    * Security - using ACL (Access Control Lists) and 
      bucket policies

S3 is object-based storage. The data itself is spread across multiple locations.

Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB. There is unlimited storage.<br>
Files are stored in buckets. Bucket name must be globally unique

    * For example: https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/mybucket
    * HTTP 200 code is returned when a file is uploaded successfully to S3

Objects consist of:

    * Key - name of the object
    * Value - the data itself
    * Version ID - used for versioning
    * Metadata - data about the data
        
Data consistency

    * New objects - writing a new file, you will be able immediately read it
    * Overwrite and deletes - updating a file or deleting it, you may get the older version when reading it as changes to objects can take some time to be applied

Transfer Acceleration

    * when used, users will upload a file to the edge location which will then upload the files from edge locations to the bucket in specific location using optimized network path (Amazon internal network)

Cross Region Replication

    * For example: you have a bucket in Europe and you upload there a file from USA. This file will be replicated to USA region.

Charges

    * You are charged for the following: storage, requests, storage management, data transfer, transfer acceleration and cross region replication

Storage Classes

    * S3 standard - 99.99% availability and 11x9 durability
    * S3 IA - Infrequently access but rapid access when needed
    * S3 One Zone IA - lower cost option for IA without multiple AZ data resilience
    * S3 Intelligent Tiering -  ML based, designed to optimized costs by automatically moving to most cost-effective access tier
    * S3 Glacier - secure, durable and low-cost storage for data archiving
    * S3 Glacier Deep Archive - most lost cost storage class where a retrieval time of 12 hours is fine

Hosting a website

    * You can host static websites on s3
    * You cannot host dynamic websites on s3
    * s3 scales automatically to meet your website demands
